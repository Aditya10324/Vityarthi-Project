# Vityarthi-Project

A brief, one-to-two sentence description of your project and what it does.

## Description

*   The program is a game called Hangman.
*   The project will help students relieve stress and enjoy while at the same time learn new words and brainstorm to win the game.
*   I have used Python programming language and it's basic functions to create this game.
*   I encountered a problem while trying to put the correctly guessed alphabets in their right places because a correctly guesserd letter can occur more than        once in a word and therefore identifying them and putting '_' on the rest of the missing letters was a problem that I encountered and overcame.
